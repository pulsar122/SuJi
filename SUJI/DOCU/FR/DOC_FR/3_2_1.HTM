In this dialog, which you can call up with Alternate-O when the list 
window is open, you can choose the items that are displayed in the 
list of found files. Clicking on a checkbox sets or removes the cross.
<br><p>
Only the crossed items will be displayed. However, the program 
retains all the hidden information, which can be displayed again 
by changing the selections in the Options dialog.
<br><p>
In addition one can choose which columns are to be written to the 
clipboard.
